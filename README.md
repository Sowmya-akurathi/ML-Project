Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project utilizes CNNs to automatically classify and recognize digits (0-9) from images of handwritten digits.

Features
CNN Model: A convolutional neural network architecture is used for feature extraction and classification.
MNIST Dataset: The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
Prediction: Once trained, the model can predict digits from new handwritten images.
Installation
