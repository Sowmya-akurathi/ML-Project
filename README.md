## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Normalizes and resizes input images for consistent model input.
- **CNN Model**: Utilizes a deep learning architecture to classify handwritten digits.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can input their own images for digit recognition.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation is the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is split as follows:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images for training the model.
- **Validation Set**: 10,000 images for evaluating model performance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/handwritten_digit_recognition.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd handwritten_digit_recognition
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train the model, run the following command in your terminal:

python train_model.py
To predict on a new handwritten digit image, run:

python predict.py --image path_to_your_image.jpg
Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

Several convolutional layers to extract features from the input images.
Max pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
Fully connected layers for final classification.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 98% on the validation dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits.
